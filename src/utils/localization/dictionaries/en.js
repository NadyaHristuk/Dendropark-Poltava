				"The park's peculiarity is its topography: many viewpoints offering interesting perspectives and bright lawns. The main route is a path that starts from the entrance from Yakovchanska Street, runs along the western gully, across the valley to the east, and ends at the entrance from Lugova Street. All viewpoints, a cascade of ponds, a system of lawns, and groups of ornamental plants are concentrated on this line. When developing the park, the existing network of trails was taken into account, which had its positive effects. The roads were graded, but then allowed to grow overgrown, which created a natural look.",

The bottom of the gully is a large meadow with lilacs, deutzia, hemlock, round snowberry, silver maple, mountain ash, white poplar, and pyramidal poplar planted in clumps. Under the viewpoint No. 4, at the bottom of the dam, there is silver moss and scots pine. A steep slope of this site borders the collection site at the top. At the top of the slope, walnut, vinegar sumac, and scots pine are planted. At the bottom of the slope, there are common spruce, hemlock, dogwood, forsythia, pteleus, scumpia, and western skeleton.',

			fourthCardTitle: 'The Swedish Forest',
			fourthCardDescription:
				' (Yakivchansky Forest, Tamarin Forest) is a remnant of a natural oak forest that is now part of Poltava City Park. 300 years ago, this forest was dense, difficult to traverse, and covered a much larger area. Only 17.94 hectares of this forest have survived to this day, and they are of the old-growth origin. More than a hundred hectares of the forest were destroyed by the German National Socialists during World War II to heat barracks. Today, the Swedish Forest site is located in the northwestern part of Poltava City Park. In the center of the Yakivchansky Forest there is a clearing from which 8 radial alleys diverge. They were laid to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Poltava. According to the original idea, each alley opened up a new view. The tree stand of this section of the Park is dominated by 130-140-year-old oaks with an admixture of heart-leaved linden, sharp-leaved maples and field maples. The Yakivchansky forest begins to the left of the main entrance to the Park. Its edge is a large clearing with single mighty oaks. Among them there are two forms of common oak - early and late. They can be easily distinguished in spring and winter. The former sheds its leaves for the winter, while the latter does so only in the spring of the following year (for this reason, the plant is also called a non-ligneous oak). The common oak is the best and most valuable species of our deciduous forests. The oak tree lives up to a thousand years, and some trees up to two thousand years. The scientific name of oak is Quercus, which means a beautiful, strong tree in Celtic. Oak is good at cleaning the air from dust and soot.',

				'The forest-steppe zone covers an area of 5 hectares. It is located in the northern part of the park on the border with the village of Yakivtsi. The planting was carried out in 1962. According to the preliminary plan, the entire territory of the park was to be divided into geographical zones of the USSR. Therefore, the Forest-Steppe zone appeared. This area, the entrance to the park from the village of Yakivtsi, is in good condition. ',
			sixthCardTitle: 'Northern Gully',
			sixthCardDescription:
				'The Northern Gully is a narrow, very deep ravine with steep slopes. It was planted until 1962 with root trees and shrubs. A pond was planned: the pond mirror was 0.25 hectares, and the dam was 20 meters high. But this project was abandoned because it would have been dangerous for vacationers. A stream flows along the bottom of the ravine, which flows into pond No. 4. Pine and rowan trees are planted at the entrance to the ravine.',
			seventhCardTitle: 'Arborterium',
			seventhCardDescription:
				"The original idea of the park's collection area was to create a place where exotic plants for our area could be found. The arboretum is located on a hill between the Northern and Western Beams, along the summer cottages, and gradually descends from west to east. It begins with dense bushes of weeping forsythia, which are among the first to delight the eye with golden flowers in spring. Here we can also find holly mahonia from North America, Simon poplar from China, Japanese sophora, German medlar, Amur velvet, a relic of the Tertiary period whose ancestors grew on Earth 50 million years ago, and many other interesting plants.",

			ninthCardDescription:
				' On the southern side, it borders on the Experimental Station, on the western side - on residential development of Tarnovshchyna settlement. From the east, the boundary of the site reaches the dam of pond No. 4, from the north it borders on pond No. 3 and plot VIII. A Tronka poplar grows near the entrance from Shvedska Street. On the slope from the Experimental Station to the "Forest" there are sharp-leaved maples and Tatar maples. At the bottom of the slope, there is a spruce and birch grove. The Lesok area borders the fields of the Experimental Station. This is a part of the forest that existed throughout the park until 1942. The trees were cut down, but saved from uprooting. Therefore, the age of the oaks growing here is counted from 1942. Over time, maples, ash trees, and linden trees grew in the Forest, which grew by self-seeding. Oak is the main tree species in this area. The northern slope of the forest is prone to strong landslides. In 1970, a landslide pushed down 15 meters of soil along with young trees. ',
			tenthCardTitle: 'Eastern Valley',
			tenthCardDescription:
				'The Eastern Valley occupies the largest area - about 40 hectares. from the dam of pond No. 4 to the entrance from Luhova Street. It consists of three parts: the southern slope - below the village of Yakivtsi, the northern slope - below the Research Station, and the sole - the lower part of the valley from the fourth dam to Luhova Street. It consists of three sections: 1. The southern sl ope - near the border with Yakivtsi. Photo 1 The slope below the village of Yakivtsi is the most problematic in the park. They started planting it in the late 60s. The slope is crossed by three terraces 2-3 meters wide, laid by the Research Station after the war. Maples, ash trees, hornbeams, and poplars are planted along the steep part of the slope. This slope was subjected to a very strong landslide. Before that, three streams flowed from the slope. The bottom line was perfectly level. But after the landslide, the relief changed completely: hills and dips appeared closer to the birch grove. Unfortunately, the streams disappeared and salt water came to the surface. So the project had to be changed. There is very little oak left, but some spruce, Banks pine, scots pine, hawthorn, Simon poplar, rowan, sea buckthorn, and many different honeysuckle trees remain. Therefore, everything that grows on the saline slope must be preserved, because it is almost impossible to plant it again. In the western part of the southern slope, from viewpoint No. 8 to the saline zone, there is an alley.This area is planted with oak, scots pine, birch, and willow.Starting from the birch grove along the bottom of the slope, birch, Banks pine, common spruce, and sea buckthorn grow. 2. The northern sl ope is near the border with the Research Station. The northern slope of the Eastern Valley is much lower than the southern one.There are two terraces along it, and a shelterbelt forest runs along the border with the Experimental Station, which means that another very picturesque road has been formed.However, due to the fact that ash trees grow in the forest belt, part of the northern slope is clogged with self - seeding, which needs to be cut down.The border with the dry slope of the fourth dam, where the outlet pipe goes, is partially swampy.Silver moss grows from the northern part of the dam, and higher up, beyond the road, there is deerberry sumac and sea buckthorn.These plants are very picturesque in the fall, when the leaves and fruits of the sumac turn orange and burgundy.Closer to Luhova Street, walnut trees are planted on the terraces. 3. The sole is located between the slopes and adjacent to Luhova Street. This part of the park was supposed to be the front part, as the entrance to the park is projected from Luhova Street.Therefore, an alley was laid in the middle.There are 8 species of poplars planted at the entrance: Simone, Tronka, white, laurel, balsam, Canadian poplar, as well as Taras willow, pyramidal oak, weeping willow, spherical willow, hawthorn, Manchurian apricot, common apricot, and sea buckthorn.This is the youngest part of the park, founded in 1983.
