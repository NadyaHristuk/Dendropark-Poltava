				"The park's distinctive feature is its relief: numerous scenic areas that open up interesting perspectives, bright clearings. The main pathway starts from the entrance on Yakivchanska Street, passes through the western slope, across the valley to the east, and ends at the entrance from Luhova Street. All scenic areas, a cascade of ponds, a system of clearings, groups of decorative plants are concentrated along this line. Existing pathways were taken into account during the park's development, which had positive results. Roads were graded but then allowed to be overgrown, creating a natural appearance.",
