        "To ensure peace for bird nesting, a quiet period is in effect from April 1 to June 15. During April-May, birds and animals typically give birth to offspring. Excessive noise can scare them away or even force them to abandon their offspring. Therefore, compliance with these conditions is necessary to support the animal population. It is worth noting that the quiet season is legislatively established and regulated by Article 39 of the Law of Ukraine 'On Wildlife'. Therefore, during this time, we will not allow events with loud music, excessive noise, etc.",
